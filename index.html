While stuck with a $40,000 student loan, I am finding it very hard to find a programming job.  I must find a way to make money other than a call center phone jockey.  But being a developer, my moto is never give up.  As a developer, I have my own views of the world.  When I hear a computer can do something, I wonder about how they get a computer to do <i>that</i>.
<p>
I have asked myself in the past “why do programmers make a lot of money”?  It’s because they can solve problems.  But if nobody will hire me, what is a problem I can solve?  It isn’t hard to find a quote that 80% of market trades are done by computers, not people.  Of course, people can’t trade the market 24 hours a day, for 5 days straight, but a computer can do it :)

After several years of digging around, I was able to find data at <i>https://www.truefx.com/</i>.  Next problem, those files are quite large,  Filled with about 5 million lines like <br><i>EUR/USD,20160104 00:00:00.057,1.08516,1.08522</i>.  I wrote some C code to chew through the huge files, only to find that it took 5 hours to parse through a months worth of data.  That was another problem to solve.  Through <i>socket</i> programming, I could use TCP/IP to communicate between a server and several client threads running on another computer.  When I get that working, I still have another idle machine that could also be used.  <link href=href="socket.htm">The code can be found here.</a>

Next problem, my laptop starts getting choked up after 900 million lines are add to the DB.  My goal is to load a years worth of tic data into a table, then write code to aggregate the tic data into hourly data.  With 3 years of hourly data, I’ll start writing a Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm to try pattern matching.  If that doesn’t work out, there are a lot of example C artificial intellegence (AI) algorithms to be found at <i><a href=”https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599/01wi/admin/Assignments/nn.html”> Washington.edu, written by Karsten Kutza</a>
